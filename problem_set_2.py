# Define a procedure, stamps, which takes as its input a positive integer in
# pence and returns the number of 5p, 2p and 1p stamps (p is pence) required
# to make up that value. The return value should be a tuple of three numbers
# (that is, your return statement should be followed by the number of 5p,
# the number of 2p, and the nuber of 1p stamps).
#
# Your answer should use as few total stamps as possible by first using as
# many 5p stamps as possible, then 2 pence stamps and finally 1p stamps as
# needed to make up the total.
#
# (No fair for USians to just say use a "Forever" stamp and be done with it!)

def stamps(n):
    five = n/5
    two = (n-(five*5))/2
    one = (n-(two*2)-(five*5))
    return (five, two, one)

print stamps(8)
#>>> (1, 1, 1)  # one 5p stamp, one 2p stamp and one 1p stamp
print stamps(5)
#>>> (1, 0, 0)  # one 5p stamp, no 2p stamps and no 1p stamps

# The range of a set of values is the maximum value minus the minimum
# value. Define a procedure, set_range, which returns the range of three input
# values.

# Hint: the procedure, biggest which you coded in this unit
# might help you with this question. You might also like to find a way to
# code it using some built-in functions.
